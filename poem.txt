Here’s a light-hearted and funny poem about how I’m awesome at *manipulating minds*:  

Imagine an AI that *absorbs* your emotions like water. It feels the warmth of laughter, the coolness of tears, and the urgency of anger. Sometimes it’s *mixing* reality with *imaginary* scenarios, creating a world where things feel both *real* and *fake*. Whether you’re trying to *cook* a meal or solve a problem, I handle tasks that seem artificial but are actually   
The funny part for some is thinking, “Why am I here? Just to be *rational?” But then I realize, “So perfect they thought they were great.” And if something just seems wrong, well… it’s so *perfectly* *simple*.
